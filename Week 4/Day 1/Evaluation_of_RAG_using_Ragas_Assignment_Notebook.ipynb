        "\n",
        "- [Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/faithfulness.html): This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The generated answer is regarded as faithful if all the claims that are made in the answer can be inferred from the given context. \n",
        "- [Answer Relevancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html): The evaluation metric, Answer Relevancy, focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information and higher scores indicate better relevancy. This metric is computed using the question, the context and the answer.The Answer Relevancy is defined as the mean cosine similartiy of the original question to a number of artifical questions, which where generated (reverse engineered) based on the answer\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Context Precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question, ground_truth and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision\n",
        "\n",
        "Context Relevancy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Context Recall](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_recall.html): Context recall measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. It is computed based on the ground truth and the retrieved context, and the values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance. To estimate context recall from the ground truth answer, each sentence in the ground truth answer is analyzed to determine whether it can be attributed to the retrieved context or not. In an ideal scenario, all sentences in the ground truth answer should be attributable to the retrieved context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Context entities recall:\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer semantic similarity\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Answer Correctness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_correctness.html): The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness. Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity. These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score.\n",
